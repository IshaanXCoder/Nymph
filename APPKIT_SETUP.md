# Reown AppKit Setup Instructions

## âœ… Completed Setup

I've successfully integrated Reown AppKit (formerly WalletConnect) into your React Native app! Here's what has been set up:

### 1. Packages Installed
- `@reown/appkit-wagmi-react-native` - Main AppKit package
- `wagmi` - Ethereum library
- `viem` - TypeScript interface for Ethereum
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching
- Additional required packages for React Native compatibility

### 2. Configuration Files Created
- `babel.config.js` - Required for Expo SDK 53+ support
- `config/appkit.ts` - AppKit configuration with Wagmi setup

### 3. App Integration
- Updated `app/_layout.tsx` with WagmiProvider and QueryClientProvider
- Added AppKit button to your search screen
- Configured for multiple chains (Mainnet, Polygon, Arbitrum)

## ðŸ”§ Required: Get Your Project ID

**IMPORTANT**: You need to replace `"YOUR_PROJECT_ID"` in `config/appkit.ts` with your actual Reown project ID.

1. Go to [Reown Dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your Project ID
