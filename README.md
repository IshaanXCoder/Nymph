# Nymph - Anonymous Web3 Social Platform

Nymph is a revolutionary Web3 platform that enables anonymous communication within organizations while maintaining trust and authenticity through blockchain technology. Not just mobile friendly, it also leverages zk proofs, ENS domains, and on-chain randomness to create a truly private yet verifiable social experience.

## üéØ Problem Statement

People inside organizations often cannot speak freely about internal issues and culture due to fear of being identified or penalized. Existing anonymous platforms suffer from:

- **Spam and fake members** - No verification of organizational membership
- **Data collection concerns** - Platforms collect personal data/emails, compromising anonymity

## üí° Our Solution

### Core Features

#### üîê **SIWE Authentication with ZK Proofs**
- Users authenticate via **Sign-In With Ethereum (ERC-4361)** using their wallet
- Generate **zk proofs** to verify organizational membership without revealing identity using the ENS of the user. 
- Post anonymously as eg. "Someone from blocsoc.eth says..."

- **Learning without tracking** - AI classifies content interests locally
- Generate **cryptographic proofs** of interest updates without revealing exact preferences
- **Interest-based reputation** system highlighting anonymous topic contributors
- Users control their data and can prove interest levels for targeted content
